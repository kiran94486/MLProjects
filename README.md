## STUDENT PERFORMANCE CHECKER 

# Problem Statement 
- How students performance is affected due to other features such as gender,parental_control,lunch content etc  

# Models:
- I have used several models to test it out such as "Random Forest"
                "Decision Tree",
                "Gradient Boosting",
                "Linear Regression",
                "XGBRegressor":,
                "CatBoosting Regressor",
                "AdaBoost Regressor".
- Out of thses models i have sorted out the best model with high prediction values and executed it.

# Deployments:
